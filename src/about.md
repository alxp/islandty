I'm a software developer who's happily been in the Drupal and Academic publishing and digital preservation fields for more than ten years.

## Trivia

My main hobby is writing and hosting pub quiz-style trivia events. I managed to turn my endless apatite for suprising knowledge about our world into a way to share it with others and entertain people.

My trivia page is [here](/trivia) which includes links to some of the body of questions I've written over the years.

## This site

I built this site using Eleventy, with much thanks to Andy Bell's [Learn Eleventy From Scratch](https://learneleventyfromscratch.com).
