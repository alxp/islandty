## Islandora at UPEI

When I first worked at the UPEI Robertson Library we had a talented team of front and back-end web developers, and a University Librarian who all believed in the value of open source software.

We had been putting our scanned manuscripts and various collections of images into a repository system called [Fedora Commons](https://duraspace.org/fedora/). We wanted to simultaneously show these collections to the university community and the wider public. That led to the development of a Drupal-based gallery that let our librarians manage and curate the digital assets for many different purposes.

We believed our work could be more widely useful, so we first put it up on [GitHub](https://github.com/islandora/islandora). Then as interest grew the university spun off a [non-profit foundation](https://islandora.ca/) to shepherd it into the world.

I'm pleased to be back working at the Robertson Library and actively contributing to the modern incarnation of Islandora.
