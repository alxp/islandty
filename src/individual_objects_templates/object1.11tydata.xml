    <abstract>Office copy from the original survey of Prince Edward Island showing the front of Lots 36 and 37. (No.3) The map shows the northern-most portions of Lots 36 and 37 on the north shore, east of Tracadie Bay. It identifies the northern commencements of three boundaries: the boundary between Lots 35 and 36; the boundary between Lots 36 and 37; and the boundary between Lots 37 and 38. Shading is used to indicate a sand dune area. North arrow.
