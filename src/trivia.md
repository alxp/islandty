When I lived in the San Francisco Bay Area I was the trivia host at two great locations, [Freewheel Brewing CO.](https://freewheelbrewing.com) and [Cafe Zoe](https://www.cafezoehub.com).

When the COVID-19 pandemic hit and we were all spending a lot more time indoors, I took the quiz online over Zoom, and now get to share my hobby of gathering entertaining facts about our world with an eclectic group of teams in friendly competition.
